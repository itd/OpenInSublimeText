About OpenInSublimeText
-----------------------

OpenInSublimeText is a complete rip from Henrik Nyh's
`Open in Textmate <http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/10/open-in-textmate-from-leopard-finder>`_
gadget:


Thanks to Henrik for putting that handy little gadget together!

I wanted the same functionality in the OS X Finder for Sublime Text 2
and lightly hacked Nyh's stuff to point at Sublime Text. Then, hacked
a little icon together to make it all nice.


Installing the OpenInSublimeText gadget
---------------------------------------
Here's how I'd do it:

#. Make a ``scripts`` folder in your Applications folder
#. Download a copy (or git clone) of OpenInSublimeText.app
   and drop it in that scripts folder.
   Example (from the Terminal)::

    mkdir /Applications/scripts
    cd /Applications/scripts
    git clone https://github.com/itd/OpenInSublimeText.git OpenInSublimeText.app

#. Drop the ``OpenInSublimeText`` onto a Finder window toolbar.

Well, that's about it. You're ready to go!

If you have questions you can send me a note.

It's totally awesome!
